- Docker Desktop (4.34 or above) with docker compose.
- Java Development Kit (21)
- Maven

## Architecture

The Car Management application has three components:

The following diagram represents the basic architecture of the project

```mermaid
architecture-beta
  group app[Car Management]

    service db(database)[Postgres] in app
    service api(server)[Backend] in app
    service ui(server)[Frontend] in app

    ui:R -- L:api
    api:R -- L:db
```
The Frontend (car-management-ui folder) and the Backend (car-management-api folder) components are the ones you will need to work on to implement the user stories of the exercice. Please read the Readme files in the folders of the Frontend and Backend. They have instructions to run the development environment and to test your changes.
